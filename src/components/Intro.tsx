        I'm a senior computer science student with a passion for software
        engineering, music, and photography. With a love for learning new
        technologies and exploring diverse areas of interest, I'm always up for
        a challenge. Currently, I'm honing my frontend skills in React and
        gaining valuable experience as a DevOps Engineering Intern. <br />
        <br />
        As my graduation approaches in April, I'm eager to take on a full-time
        role as a developer and continue pursuing my passion for building
        innovative software solutions. Join me on my journey as I explore the
        intersection of technology and creativity!
